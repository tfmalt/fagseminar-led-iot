# Arduino, FastLED and PlatformIO getting started

This is intended as a simple boilerplate getting started repository, to get started programming led strips with an Arduino compatible microcontroller.

In it's current state it assumes you are already familiar with PlatformIO and instructions on how to move from step to step are sparse.

If anyone asks me to add better instructions I will try to add them.

## My FastLED based bookshelf project
This workshop is based on the work I did creating audio responsive led lights for my kids bedroom. You can find that project here:
